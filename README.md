Tech News Highlights
===================
## Description
A web app for showing user highlights from tech news websites - sources & their highlights, using [newsapi](https://newsapi.org).

This is similar to a [web app]() I have already built with flask, but now with golang, as I learn it.

A user is able to click on a tech news source and view a list of articles from that source. Clicking on the news article will then redirect you to the news article's web page.

## User Requirements

1. Your users should be able to see various tech news sources and select the ones they prefer
2. Your users should be able to see all the news articles from that news source
3. The user should see the image description and time the news article was created.
4. The user should also be able to click on an article and read it fully from the news source.
